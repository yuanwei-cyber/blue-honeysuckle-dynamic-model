> *PLOS ONE* (Under Review)

## Description
The core of this repository is the file `Unstable region of the fruit stem vibration.nb, Relationship between the excitation frequency and damping ratio.nb, Stem is perpendicular to excitation direction.nb, Stem is parallel to  excitation direction.nb`. It implements the dynamic model of the Blue Honeysuckle fruit-stem system as described in the manuscript. Key operations include:
- Calculating the Unstable region of the fruit stem vibration.
- Calculating the Unstable region of Relationship between the excitation frequency and damping ratio
- Generating the amplitude-frequency response of stem is perpendicular to excitation direction.
- Generating the amplitude-frequency response of stem is parallel to excitation direction.

## Requirements
- **Software:** Wolfram *Mathematica* (Version 12.0 or higher recommended). The code has been tested on Version 12.0.
- **No additional toolboxes or packages are required.**

## Usage
1.  Download or clone this repository.
2.  Open the file in *Mathematica*.
3.  Execute the notebook cells sequentially (Press `Shift+Enter`).
4.  The main results and plots will be generated automatically. Key parameters (material properties from Table 1) are defined at the beginning of the notebook.
